# nextu_first

This is my first web site on Github. I'm doing it as part of my project to become a Web Developer.

I hope to become proficient in the use og git and github; I've been using both for some time but only as stand-alone projects, and this WebDev path I think is going to be more exciting and fulfilling to appreciate the power of Git/Github.

I hope you enjoy this first page, and I hope I'll be doing much more here.

Note: At least for now, the idea is maintaining the "nextu_ordinal" until the 10th, when I think I'll add percisely '10th' or whatever feels right in that time, though if I change it I'll try to change this note too. Greetings.
